# AI session handoff

## First reads
Read root `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/video-production-master/SKILL.md`, `docs/STATE.md`, and `video-library/one-more-scroll/manifest.json`.

## Creative decisions to preserve
- User wants cinematic story-led stick-figure video, not generic AI-looking colors or flat repeated SVG backgrounds.
- Simple character; rich environment; warm practical lighting; motivated camera/editing; expressive action; visible contact; intentional sound arc.
- References: first consult `video-library/reference-clips.json` for the user's exact examples “The Words You Never Forgot” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyFUAlGMxSE) and “What If You Were a Mentalist?” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XexSnQTMMhw), plus Ifverse Tales / Day One Films. Verify the sources are accessible and actually watch them before making timestamped claims; don't copy assets.
- The user expects honesty: “file exported” is not “visual QA passed.”
- Never confuse H2 Canvas/Chromium render with Remotion or Blender output.

- Film manifest: `video-library/one-more-scroll/manifest.json`

## Tool and video inventory
- Read `docs/TOOL_INVENTORY.md`, `video-library/previous-works-catalog.json`, and `video-library/reference-clips.json` before assuming a tool, source archive, old clip, or reference MP4 is present.
- `tools/video/archive_previous_works.py` stages prior clips by fixed SHA; the GitHub verification workflow marks them permanent only after the remote files are checked.
- `tools/video/publish_h2_source_release.ps1` uploads the large H2 source packages to a versioned GitHub Release after checksum validation.

## Artifact truth
The exact 155-second Full HD H2 master is archived at `video-library/one-more-scroll/one-more-scroll-h2-final.mp4`, SHA-256 `be0608239a374cf10c89b2c9b16e642de962cdd8f1b177de1a173219413a940f`, and verified by [workflow run 40271825143](https://github.com/Nolane-x/video/actions/runs/40271825143). The original source ZIP and scene-fixes source-v2 ZIP are durable [GitHub Release assets](https://github.com/Nolane-x/video/releases/tag/h2-production-assets-v1); exact hashes and download links are in `video-library/one-more-scroll/h2-source-release.json`. The Remotion reference render at `video-library/one-more-scroll/renders/remotion-run-36/` is a different renderer/output. Never conflate them.

## End-of-session
Run checks; inspect contact sheets and motion proofs; record exact renderer, commit, run URL, artifact storage/expiry, audio measures, defects and next actions. Update `docs/STATE.md`, this file and the per-video manifest.
